# Toddler Hybrid Tracker - Child Safety Monitoring System

## 1. Business Purpose: Peace of Mind Through Technology

### The Challenge
Modern parents face the constant balance between allowing children independence to play and explore while ensuring their safety. Traditional supervision methods require constant visual monitoring, limiting both child freedom and parental peace of mind.

### Our Solution
**ToddlerTracker** is a comprehensive child safety monitoring system designed specifically for **tracking a child in the yard** so that **parents can feel calmer and more confident in their supervision**. 

Using advanced AI recognition technology combined with accurate 3D yard mapping, the system provides:

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated tracking across multiple camera angles without requiring constant parental attention
- **Intelligent Alerts**: Smart notifications only when children move outside predetermined safe zones
- **Visual Confirmation**: Real-time position display on accurate yard maps for instant situational awareness
- **Reliable Identification**: Multi-modal recognition that works even when children aren't facing cameras directly

### The Result
Parents gain the confidence to allow supervised outdoor play while maintaining awareness of their child's location and safety status. The system reduces anxiety while promoting healthy outdoor activity and age-appropriate independence.
